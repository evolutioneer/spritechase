# get_snapshot
# A *nix command file that looks recursively in a folder structure for files of the given extension and writes per line to stdout:
# 1) a "timestamp" of the last time the file was touched (based on ls -lA)
# 2) the relative path to the file
#
# when calling get_snapshot, the first parameter is the base directory to seach from; the second parameter is the file extension.
# hence "get_snapshot /my/project/folder css" will recursively find every css file in /my/project/folder,
# along with the timestamp it was last modified on.
